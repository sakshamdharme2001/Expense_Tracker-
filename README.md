Expence_Tracker-
The Expense Tracker Application is built using Java Spring Boot, featuring RESTful services and CRUD operations with both H2 (in-memory database) and Remote MySQL. This application enables users to manage their expenses efficiently by adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving transaction records. It incorporates Spring Security for secure API access, ensuring data protection. The backend is designed with Spring Data JPA for seamless database interaction, while proper exception handling and data validation enhance reliability.

This project serves as a hands-on implementation of Spring Boot fundamentals, database management, and cloud deployment, providing a solid foundation in backend development. ðŸš€
